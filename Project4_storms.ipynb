    "The two-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) equations describe the motion of two vertically-stacked shallow layers of fluid in the limit where the Rossby number, $Ro=U/fL$ is small, where $U$ is a characteristic velocity scale, $L$ is a characteristic horizontal lengthscale, and $f$ is the Coriolis parameter. Here, we will use `1` to refer to quantitites in the upper layer and `2` to refer to quantities in the lower layer.\n",

When the interface separating the upper and lower layers isn't flat, the varying thicknesses of the upper and lower layers implies that there are horizontal gradients in the hydrostatic pressure. When the Rossby number is small, $Ro\\ll 1$, the flow will tend to be close to geostrophic balance a velocity difference between the upper and lower layer that balances the horizontal pressure gradients.\n",

    "## 1. Two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations in a periodic box\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will solve a non-dimensional version of the two-layer QG equations in Cartesian coordinates. Let $+x$ denote the eastwards direction and $+y$ denote the northwards direction. We start with a flow in geostrophic balance where the velocity is constant in each layer. Let $U \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ denote the velocity in the top layer and $-U \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ denote the velocity in the bottom layer. Geostrophic balance then implies that the interface has a constant, non-zero slope. We will invoke the so-called \"beta-plane\" approximation and make the Coriolis parameter a linear function of $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we solve for the departures to the background state described above. We let $q_1$ and $q_2$ denote the perturbation QG potential vorticity and $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ denote the perturbation streamfunction. Although the background state is not periodic, we apply periodic boundary conditions in $x$ and $y$ to the perturbation quantities. This has the effect of maintaining the north/south potential vorticity gradient associated with the background state.\n",

    "$$ \\partial_t(q_2) - U \\partial_x(q_2) - \\frac{2U}{R_{d2}^2}\\partial_x(\\psi_2)-\\nu \\nabla^2 q_2 = - J(\\psi_2, q_2), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_{d1,2}=\\sqrt{g'H_{1,2}}/f_0$ is the internal deformation radius in each layer, $g'=(\\rho_2-\\rho_1)/\\rho_0$ is the reduced gravity, $\\rho_0$ is a reference density, $J(a,b)=\\partial_x(a)\\partial_y(b) - \\partial_y(a)\\partial_x(b)$ is the Jacobian operator and $\\nu$ is a viscosity which is added to keep the model stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the equations above, two other equations relate the perturbation potential vorticity and streamfunctions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q_1=\\nabla^2\\psi_1 - \\frac{\\psi_1-\\psi_2}{R_{d1}^2}, $$\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Tau method\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations above are invariant to a constant added to $\\psi_1-\\psi_2$. Therefore, there are infinitely many solutions to the above equations and the coefficient matrix associated with the discretized equations will be singular. To avoid this, we can add an extra equation to the system to set this constant offset. Here, we do this by including the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int\\int \\psi_1 dxdy = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which in effect ensures that the spatial mean of $\\psi_1$ is zero. The problem now is that we have five equations for four unknowns. One fix is to include another unknown in our system. We will include a constant called $\\tau_{\\psi1}$ and we will add it to the equation relating the upper layer QG potential voricity and streamfunction which then becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q_1=\\nabla^2\\psi_1 - \\frac{\\psi_1-\\psi_2}{R_{d1}^2} + \\tau_{\\psi1}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since adding a constant to the potential vorticity and streamfunction doesn't have any impact on the dynamics of the system, adding $\\tau_{\\psi1}$ here won't cause any problems and we now have a fully constained set of equations.\n"

    "## 2. Jet stream and the dimensional QG equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration in the previous section illustrates baroclinic instability, but the setup is quite idealized. In particular, we assumed that the Coriolis parameter and the initial velocity were constant. In the atmosphere there is are strong winds at the top of the troposphere in a band called the jet stream. The jet stream is several hundred kilometers wide with wind speeds that can exceed 100 miles per hour (roughly 50 m/s). A variable Coriolis parameter is important for constraining the jet dynamics. If we use $f=f_0+\\beta y$, then the equations for $q_1$ and $q_2$ become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\partial_t(q_1) + U_1 \\partial_x(q_1) + \\partial_x(\\psi_1)\\left(\\beta + \\frac{U_1-U_2}{R_{d1}^2}\\right)+\\nu_4 \\nabla^4 q_1 = - J(\\psi_1, q_1), $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we have also switched from a viscous term to a 'hyperviscous' term, where $-\\nabla^2 q_{1,2}$ has been replaced by $\\nabla^4 q_{1,2}$ where $\\nabla^4=(\\nabla^2)^2=(\\partial^2_x+\\partial^2_y)^2$. Using a hyperviscosity is useful because it acts to preferentially damp small scale motions (with large horizontal wavenumbers), while having less influence on the larger scale motions (with small horizontal wavenumbers). It is useful in this case since we would like the jet not to be strongly influenced by viscosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simulate baroclinic instability on the jet stream by localizing the north/south gradient in the QG potential voriticty in the center of our computational domain. However, since our boundary conditions are periodic, we need the potential vorticity that we solve for to be equal at the northern and southern boundaries. We can accomplish this with the following trick. For our initial condition, let the total potential vorticity in layer 1 be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ q_1 = Q_1 tanh\\left(\\frac{y-Ly/2}{w}\\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Ly$ is the domain size, $Q_1$ is a constant dimensional amplitude and $w$ is the jet width. Clearly $q_1$ isn't periodic in the y-direction. Instead, we can impose a uniform background potential vorticity gradient (as we did in Section 1 above) and solve for the departure from this background gradient. We can then set the amplitude of the background gradient to make the <em>departure</em> from the background gradient periodic. Specifically, the departure from the background potential vorticity gradient will be:\n",

    "$$ q_1 = Q_1 (tanh\\left(\\frac{y-Ly/2}{w}\\right) - \\frac{y-Ly/2}{Ly/2}) $$\n",
