# QCES
Computational projects for Quantitative Climate and Environmental Science course

The computational projects consist of a set of Jupyter notebooks which contain project descriptions and python code. Project 1 has two notebooks and you should start first with the numerical methods notebook followed by the Dedalus notebook.

We recommend that you use Github to keep your notebooks up to date with any bug fixes or corrections to the notebooks in this repository.
